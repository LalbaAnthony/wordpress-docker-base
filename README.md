# Base Wordpress using Docker

A default WordPress environment using Docker, designed to be used as a base for WordPress development projects. This setup includes a MariaDB database and is configured to work with the latest version of WordPress.

## üöÄ - Quick start

1. Clone the rep
   ```bash
   git clone <URL>
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Ensure all bash files are saved with Unix line endings (`LF`) and not Windows line endings (`CRLF`).

### üêã - With Docker

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Debug

```bash
# Check that wp-config.php is correctly configured
docker exec -it myproject_backend_wp sh
grep -E "DB_(HOST|NAME|USER|PASSWORD)" /var/www/html/wp-config.php

# Check that database is correctly configured
docker exec -it myproject_database_mariadb sh
mariadb -u root -p # ? Connect using MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

## üõ†Ô∏è - Configuration

First, customize the `.env` file to set your environment variables. This file contains sensitive information such as database credentials and should not be shared publicly.

Also, you may want to replace all `myproject_` prefixes with your own project key to avoid conflicts with container names and volumes in your Docker environment.
This can be done by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `.env` file, or simply searching for `myproject_` in the project directory and replacing it with your desired prefix.
